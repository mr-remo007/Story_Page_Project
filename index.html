The current Flame Hashira after inheriting the title from his father Shinjuro.
 Though he comes off as boisterous and cheerfully eccentric, Kyojuro is pure-hearted and honorable due to his mother instilling in him a moral code of protecting the weak.
  He was assigned to investigate the Mugen Train, with Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko aiding him to dispatch Enmu. After their battle with Enmu, he meets Akaza of the Twelve Kizuki. Akaza proposes that Kyojuro turn into a demon so they can fight for all of eternity, to which Kyojuro flatly declines. He is ultimately killed by Akaza.
   After using his last moments to direct Tanjiro to his father, the youth had the tsuba of Kyojuro's broken sword installed into his new sword in respect of the Hashira.In the Reiwa Era, he is reincarnated as a teenage student.

<p>Holding the position of Upper Rank Three, he is a demon who despises whoever he considers weak and offers those he considers strong enough to have his respect the chance to become demons.
     He was once a human called Hakuji (狛治) who stole as a child to care for his ailing father before he committed suicide to free his burdened son. Hakuji was adopted by a martial artist named Keizo and trained under him while falling in love with his master's daughter Koyuki. Hakuji loses his new family when they were poisoned by a rival dojo who were unable to beat him in a fair fight, leading him to slaughter them all single-handedly before being turned into a demon by Muzan. Akaza fatally wounds and kills Kyojuro and later battles Tanjiro and Giyu. During their battle,
     he regains his human memories and commits suicide by voluntarily ceasing his regeneration and dying from his wounds.</p>
